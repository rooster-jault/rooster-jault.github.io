<!-- div 3 is about my profesional time with Nuits Blanches and as a freelance creative -->
<div>
    <h2>
        Down to business. Creative business.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Since before his time in business school, Philippe has always worked with his creative side. For 4 years he was the Head of Audiovisual Content & Events at Les Nuits Blanches asbl, handling the production of several short films, exhibitions, projections and events. Managing teams as well as time is a core skill he developped.
    </p>
    <p>
        He also ran his own freelance business, producing and directing music videos for young, up and coming musicians from Brussels. Working on several projects at a time helped him come up with a system to keep track of many things at once, ensuring happy and satisfied clients at every turn.

<!-- div 4 is about my external hobbies, including oly lifting, photography and cweb dev-->
<div>
    <h2>
        Work hard. Play hard.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Even the hardest worker has to decompress at the end of the day. Philippe enjoys a diverse set of hobbies to take his mind off of the working day. Most days of the week he practices Olympic Weightlifting. A sport he got into a couple of years ago, he is working his way up to be able to lift on a competitive level. Progress is slow, but that is the nature of the sport. Repitition and dedication is key, creating a space where you are able to zone out for a couple of hours and focus on yourself. He also has a keen interest for learning new things. Over the past year he has taught himself the basics of web development, and more recently he has gotten into darkroom photography printing, learning the ins and outs of the chemistry, paper and darkroom process.

<!-- div 5 is about my bilinguism and living a little around the worls, giving me access to many cultures-->
<div>
    <h2>
        Philippe. Now available in two languages.
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Philippe est parfaitement bilingue en fran çais et en anglais. Son père est français et sa mère américaine, créant un mélange de culture et de langue depuis son plus jeune age. Il a eu l’occasion de voyager grâce à cela, que ce soit autour d’Europe, aux États-Unis, ou même un séjour de un an au Japon. Toutes ces expériences intimes avec ces cultures lui permettent d’avoir de la compassion avec des gens de toutes sortes.
    </p>
</div>
<!-- div 6 is the closing words-->
<div>
    <p>
        Philippe is a diverse, passionate and driven person that is excited to get started! Speaking, helping and connecting with people is hugely important to him. Working in a space that gives him that is where he will shine.
